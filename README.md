# Memory Network and Multiple Observer Models

Memory network model originally developed by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/MemNN).
Code base was adapted from [domluna's implementation](https://github.com/domluna/memn2n) with major
contributions from [eringrant](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eringrant/).

This is part of a series of repositories for our 2018 EMNLP Paper.
Please see the [original repository](https://github.com/kayburns/tom-qa-dataset.git) for information on the dataset.
